*** introduction of NGS??????
->  Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is a technology for determining the sequence of DNA or RNA to study genetic variation associated with diseases or other biological phenomena.  Introduced for commercial use in 2005, this method was initially called “massively-parallel sequencing”, because it enabled the sequencing of many DNA strands at the same time, instead of one at a time as with traditional Sanger sequencing by capillary electrophoresis (CE).Each of these technologies has utility in today’s genetic analysis environment. Sanger sequencing is best for analyzing small numbers of gene targets and samples and can be accomplished in a single day. NGS enables the interrogation of hundreds to thousands of genes at one time in multiple samples, as well as discovery and analysis of different types of genomic features in a single sequencing run, from single nucleotide variants (SNVs), to copy number and structural variants, accuracy of NGS has revolutionized genetic analysis and enabled new applications in genomic and clinical research, reproductive health, and environmental, agricultural, and forensic science.
